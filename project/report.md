## Abstract

## Introduction

## Related Work

## Architecture

We leverage or improve <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cm-burn>

Our goal is to craete and contrast the creation of Federated kubernetes clusters. We have different models

1. The clusters are owned by a single user
2. The clusters are owned by multiple users

Goal is to create a federation of them. In each case the fedaration can be achieved in one of two ways. 

1. consider a big kubernetis cluster that integrates all resources
2. consider a cluster of kubernetes clusters

This requires some investigation into kubernetes

Some images are shown in cm-burn that we may want tocopy here.
